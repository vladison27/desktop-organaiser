# desktop-organaiser
This program will help you organize your desktop. It puts videos, audio, photos, and documents in their respective folders on the desktop. If the program doesn't work or gives an error, create the folders "Videos" "Audios" "Pictures" "Documents".

This version is still raw, so I will update it. In the future, you will be able to minimize the program to the system tray, as well as add and remove extensions used.
